LecroyWFDecoder.cpp
Waveform.hpp         - Rolf 19 Feb 2013
Extended code to read the scope data (sample_t) as short (for waveform saved as "Binary
-> Word") instead of as char* (when saving as "Binary -> Byte").

readrawdata.cc:				- Matteo 5 Aug 2012
It checks if waveform file is present; if not stops execution.


v0.0.1
---------

It just works! With binary(byte) oscilloscope data and merging both raw data in one ROOT file. A waveform class manages the oscilloscope data.
